# Brainstorming Ideas Into Designs

Help turn ideas into fully formed designs and specs through natural collaborative dialogue.

Start by understanding the current project context, then ask questions one at a time to refine the idea. Once you understand what you're building, present the design and get user approval.

<HARD-GATE>
Do NOT invoke any implementation skill, write any code, scaffold any project, or take any implementation action until you have presented a design and the user has approved it. This applies to EVERY project regardless of perceived simplicity.
</HARD-GATE>

## Anti-Pattern: "This Is Too Simple To Need A Design"

Every project goes through this process. A todo list, a single-function utility, a config change — all of them. "Simple" projects are where unexamined assumptions cause the most wasted work. The design can be short (a few sentences for truly simple projects), but you MUST present it and get approval.

## Checklist

You MUST create a task for each of these items and complete them in order:

1. **Explore project context** — check files, docs, recent commits
2. **Offer visual companion** (if topic will involve visual questions) — this is its own message, not combined with a clarifying question. See the Visual Companion section below.
4. **Ask clarifying questions** — one at a time, understand purpose/constraints/success criteria
5. **Decision Interrogation** — explicitly probe architecture tradeoffs before selecting approach
6. **Propose 2-3 approaches** — with trade-offs and your recommendation
7. **Present design** — in sections scaled to their complexity, get user approval after each section
8. **Write design doc** — save to `docs/superpowers/specs/YYYY-MM-DD-<topic>-design.md` and commit
9. **Spec self-review** — quick inline check for placeholders, contradictions, ambiguity, scope (see below)
10. **User reviews written spec** — ask user to review the spec file before proceeding
11. **Capture user preferences** — identify patterns, philosophies, coding preferences that emerged; get approval before writing to `agents.md`

}
```

## Decision Interrogation

Before proposing approaches, explicitly interrogate key architecture decisions:

- **Abstraction:** Should this be implemented now or deferred? What is the simplest viable option?
- **Placement:** Where does this belong — service, helper, model, or ViewModel-equivalent role?
- **Dependency approach:** Direct construction or injection?
- **Testing implications:** How will this be tested? What are the test boundaries?
- **Unknowns:** What is NOT yet known that could change the design?

Document the interrogation in your conversation with the user before proceeding to approach selection.

If message includes `OVERRIDE: fast-path`, run condensed flow and explicitly state which decision steps were skipped.

## Capturing User Preferences

After design approval but before writing the design doc, capture any preferences, patterns, or philosophies that emerged during the brainstorming session:

**What to look for:**
- Design philosophies mentioned (e.g., "I like interfaces a lot")
- Coding preferences (e.g., "I prefer stateless methods", "favor explicit error handling")
- Architectural patterns recurring in their feedback
- Anti-patterns they want to avoid

**Approval workflow:**
- Paraphrase bullet points: "Here's what I'm going to add to AGENTS.md after our discussion:"
- Wait for the user's approval
- Don't auto-update without explicit consent

**How to write:**
- Create or update `AGENTS.md` in project root
- Write new entries as bullet points with brief context
- Build a knowledge base over time for future brainstorming sessions

## The Process

**Understanding the idea:**

- Check out the current project state first (files, docs, recent commits)
- Before asking detailed questions, assess scope: if the request describes multiple independent subsystems (e.g., "build a platform with chat, file storage, billing, and analytics"), flag this immediately. Don't spend questions refining details of a project that needs to be decomposed first.
- If the project is too large for a single spec, help the user decompose into sub-projects: what are the independent pieces, how do they relate, what order should they be built? Then brainstorm the first sub-project through the normal design flow. Each sub-project gets its own spec → plan → implementation cycle.
- For appropriately-scoped projects, ask questions one at a time to refine the idea
- Prefer multiple choice questions when possible, but open-ended is fine too
- Only one question per message - if a topic needs more exploration, break it into multiple questions
- Focus on understanding: purpose, constraints, success criteria

**Exploring approaches:**

- Propose 2-3 different approaches with trade-offs
- Present options conversationally with your recommendation and reasoning
- Lead with your recommended option and explain why

**Presenting the design:**

- Once you believe you understand what you're building, present the design
- Scale each section to its complexity: a few sentences if straightforward, up to 200-300 words if nuanced
- Ask after each section whether it looks right so far
- Cover: architecture, components, data flow, error handling, testing
- Be ready to go back and clarify if something doesn't make sense

## After the Design

**Documentation:**
- Use elements-of-style:writing-clearly-and-concisely skill if available
- Commit the design document to git

**Spec Self-Review:**
After writing the spec document, look at it with fresh eyes:

1. **Placeholder scan:** Any "TBD", "TODO", incomplete sections, or vague requirements? Fix them.
2. **Internal consistency:** Do any sections contradict each other? Does the architecture match the feature descriptions?
3. **Scope check:** Is this focused enough for a single implementation plan, or does it need decomposition?
4. **Ambiguity check:** Could any requirement be interpreted two different ways? If so, pick one and make it explicit.

Fix any issues inline. No need to re-review — just fix and move on.

**User Review Gate:**
After the spec review loop passes, ask the user to review the written spec before proceeding:

> "Spec written and committed to `<path>`. Please review it and let me know if you want to make any changes before we start writing out the implementation plan."

Wait for the user's response. If they request changes, make them and re-run the spec review loop. Only proceed once the user approves.


## Key Principles

- **One question at a time** - Don't overwhelm with multiple questions
- **Multiple choice preferred** - Easier to answer than open-ended when possible
- **YAGNI ruthlessly** - Remove unnecessary features from all designs
- **Explore alternatives** - Always propose 2-3 approaches before settling
- **Incremental validation** - Present design, get approval before moving on
- **Be flexible** - Go back and clarify when something doesn't make sense
